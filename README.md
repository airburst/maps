# Maps

This web app will enable users to create routes on Ordnance Survey or Google Maps.  Routes will be able to automatically follow roads and will generate an elevation profile.

Users will be able to save routes, embed them into other websites via an embed url and export to / import from .gpx format for Garmin devices.
